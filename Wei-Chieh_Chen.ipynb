    "`hash_code2()` does another way, it first multiplies the ascii value of the 6 characters, then the product is divided by the last digit plus 1 (in case of 0). According to the design, this method is supposed to lower the collision compared to `hash_code1()`.\n",
    "\n",

    "`hash_code3()` utilizes the conventional SHA-1 algorithm in the `hashlib` module. SHA-1 can generate a 40-digit hash code (hex value) regardless of input string length, but in this case, I changed the output hash code into decimal value. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Question 4.1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "With the random ordered input, quick sort provides the average time complexity of `O(n logn)`. This is the sum of the time usage considering all possible pivot then divide by `n`. Although quick sort has the worst-case time complexity of `O(n^2)`, we do not really concern it since it is unlikely to happen in real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4.1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort compares the selected element to the ones of the sorted sequence from its tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average time complexity of insertion sort is `O(n^2)`. Yet insertion sort takes linear time when the input array is nearly sorted. In such situation it is one of the best compare-based sorting algorithms to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other choices have bigger time complesity than the one of insertion sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4.1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we take the reversed input as the worst case. Since it is inevitable for discussing worst-case performance when it comes to algorithm, a reversed ordered input array is also a popular issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap sort offers the worst-case time complexity of `O(n logn)`, which outperfroms the other kinds of sorting algorithms in this question.\n",

    "\n",
    "a. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the merge sort algorithm breaks down the input array recursively until every segment only contains one element. Then compare the two segments in each group to determine the internal order and merge the two elements into one. After that we can get n/2 groups of arrays which have length of 2, then we repeat the step until the sorted sequences are merged back to a single array.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both merge sort and quick sort belong to divide and conquor algorithm. The difference between them is how to divide the array into small pieces. Quick sort chooses pivots randomly in every recursion then sorts the subsequences, while merge sort mostly recursively chooses the middle point of the array as the pivot and divide it, and then swap the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though merge sort has a more acceptable worst-case time complexity `O(n logn)` than the one of quick sort `O(n^2)`, we cannot take the worst case too seriously since the worst case for quick sort rarely happens. In fact, they share the similar average time complexity of `O(n logn)`\n",
